# Coordination-number-calculation-for-NPs

This simple and small R code calculates coordination number for a given xyz coordinates of gold NP. It has example file uploaded here (Min12.5_155.xyz). criteria_neighbor parameter can be changed but default 3.2 Angstrom is enough to consider all neighbor atoms. 
To calculate size distrubition of a given spherical gold NP, consider CN<12 atoms on surface.
